# Scope Creep
Play a game where you are the external producer and keep adding new features that introduce new bugs. Use thouse bugs to justify new features that introduce even more bugs!

**This is a game made in REACT, in one weekend WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE of React or any other frontend web development framework**  
You should not take this as a good way to do anything. This is me, picking a technology I never used and doing something in a weekend.  
I suck at designing and suck even harder at CSS.

Enough Disclaimer, now the features:

- Random repo name generator and random username generator (based on [foswig](https://github.com/mrsharpoblunto/foswig.js/) and the [100 most commiting people on github](git.io/top))
- Random feature generator by matching words that end in *"-ify"* with buzzwords.
- Big numbers provided by [break_infinity](https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js)
- UI via [Blueprintjs](https://blueprintjs.com/)
- Your games saves automagically and also has a button to nuke it.
- If a feature reaches 5 merges you can add a new feature.
- Every 10 merges you get a global 1% boost
- There is no endgame nor prestige thingies. I made this as a tinkering exercise.
