# Scope Creep
Play a game where you are the external producer and keep adding new features that introduce new bugs. Use thouse bugs to justify new features that introduce even more bugs!

**This is a game made in REACT, in one weekend WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE of React or any other frontend web development framework**  
You should not take this as a good way to do anything. This is me, picking a technology I never used and doing something in a weekend.
